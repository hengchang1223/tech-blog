title:  "LeetCode 141. Linked List Cycle"
lcid: 141
categories: [Two Pointers]
---
## Description:
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## Example:
Input: `head = [3,2,0,-4]` `pos = 1`

Output: `True`

Input: `head = [1]` `pos = -1`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Assign two pointers, one is faster than the other one, so that if there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer at some point.

## Solution:
```python
def hasCycle(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return False
    fast, slow = head, head
    while fast.next and fast.next.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        if fast == slow:
            return True
    return False
```
