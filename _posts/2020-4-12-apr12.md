title:  "LeetCode 1046. Last Stone Weight (April Challenge Day #12)" 
lcid: 1046
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

## Example:
Input: `[2,7,4,1,8,1]`

Output: `1`

## Solution Explanation:
It involves a lot of sorting obviously, and after each loop, there will be a new value need to be inserted into this array. **Heap** will be the ideal way to do this. 

In Python3, you need first convert array into heap: `heapq.heapify(arr)`. And `arr` will by default become a **min heap**. Then you can use `heapq.heappop(arr)` to get the minimal element of the heap and `heapq.heappush(arr, value)` to insert `value` into the heap.

## Solution:

```python
def lastStoneWeight(stones: List[int]) -> int:
    h = [-x for x in stones]
    heapq.heapify(h)

    while len(h) >1 and h[0] != 0:
        heapq.heappush(h, heapq.heappop(h)- heapq.heappop(h))

    return -h[0]
```
