title:  "LeetCode 844. Backspace String Compare (April Challenge Day #9)" 
lcid: 844
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

## Example:
Input: `S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"`

Output: `True`

Input: `S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"`

Output: `True`

## Solution Explanation:
Although this is not the optimal solution (there is a `O(1)` space complexity solution). This way is more nature and eaiser to understand. Basically you are building two strings by looping through the strings. 

## Solution:

```python
def backspaceCompare(S, T):
    def build(S):
        ans = []
        for c in S:
            if c != '#':
                ans.append(c)
            elif ans:
                ans.pop()
        return "".join(ans)
    return build(S) == build(T)
```
