title:  "LeetCode 345. Reverse Vowels of a String"
categories: [Two Pointers]
---
## Description:
Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

## Example:
Input: `"hello"`

Output: `"holle"`

Input: `"leetcode"`

Output: `"leotcede"`

## Solution Explanation:
This case is a little tricky, you need to assign one pointer that moves from the head of string to the end of string. This pointer will copy the non-vowel chars it sees, and if it sees a vowel, it will wait for the second pointer told it which vowel it should replace for current vowel.

## Solution:
```python
def reverseVowels(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    p1, p2 = 0, n - 1
    res = ''
    vowels = set(['a', 'o', 'e', 'i', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'O', 'I', 'U'])
    while p1 < n:
        if s[p1] not in vowels:
            res += s[p1]
        else:
            # s[p1] is a vowel
            while p2 >= 0 and s[p2] not in vowels:
                p2 -= 1
            res += s[p2]
            p2 -= 1
        p1 += 1
    return res
```
