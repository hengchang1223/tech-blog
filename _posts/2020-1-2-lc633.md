## Description:
Given a non-negative integer `c`, your task is to decide whether there're two integers `a` and `b` such that `a * a + b * b = c`.

## Example:
Input: `5`

Output: `True`

Input: `3`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Typical two pointers problem, integers from `0` to `int(pow(c, 0.5))` will be the sorted array like the problem above. You just need to assign two pointers, one from 0 to bigger integer, the other from `int(pow(c, 0.5))` to smaller integer. Use while loop to check if there are two integers which can be added up to target.

## Solution:
```python
def judgeSquareSum(c: int) -> bool:
    p1, p2 = 0, int(pow(c, 0.5))
    while p1 <= p2:
        curr_sum = p1 * p1 + p2 * p2
        if curr_sum == c:
            return True
        elif curr_sum < c:
            p1 += 1
        else:
            p2 -= 1
    return False
```
