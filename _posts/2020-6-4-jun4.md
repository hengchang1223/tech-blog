categories: [June Challenge]

## Description:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** `in-place` with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

## Example:
Input: `["h","e","l","l","o"]`

Output: `["o","l","l","e","h"]`

Input: `["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`

Output: `["h","a","n","n","a","H"]`

## Solution Explanation:
Two pointers exchange value in place.

## Solution:

```python
def reverseString(s: List[str]) -> None:
    if s:
        left, right = 0, len(s)-1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```
