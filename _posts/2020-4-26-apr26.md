title:  "LeetCode 1143. Longest Common Subsequence (April Challenge Day #26)" 
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

## Example:
Input: `text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"`

Output: `3`  

Input: `text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"`

Output: `3`

Input: `text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
If you can consider using Dynamic Programming to solve this problem, you are half way to success. Use one row for recording the previous results, and another row to calculate the current optimal results from current row and previous records. Tweak the code a little bit so that you can pass your own tests, then you are good to go.

## Solution:

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    if len(text2) < len(text1):
        text1, text2 = text2, text1
    
    previous = [0] * (len(text1) + 1)
    current = [0] * (len(text1) + 1)
    
    for col in reversed(range(len(text2))):
        for row in reversed(range(len(text1))):
            if text2[col] == text1[row]:
                current[row] = 1 + previous[row + 1]
            else:
                current[row] = max(previous[row], current[row + 1])

        previous, current = current, previous
    
    return previous[0]
```
