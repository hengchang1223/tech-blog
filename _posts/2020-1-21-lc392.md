## Description:
Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Follow up:**
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Example:
Input: `s = "abc"` `t = "ahbgdc"`

Output: `True`

Input: `s = "axc"` `t = "ahbgdc"`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Basically like assign cookies, just two pointers and move them around.

## Solution:
```python
def isSubsequence(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    p1 = p2 = 0
    while p1 < len(s) and p2 < len(t):
        if s[p1] == t[p2]:
            p1 += 1
        p2 += 1
    if p1 == len(s):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
