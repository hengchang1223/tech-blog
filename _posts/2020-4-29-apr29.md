title:  "LeetCode 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (April Challenge Day #29)" 
lcid: 124
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.

## Example:
Input: `[1,2,3]`
```
       1
      / \
     2   3
```
Output: `6`

Input: `[-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
```
   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Output: `42`

## Solution Explanation:
Standard DFS, however, in this problem I prefer to use a global variable so that you can update the maximum result while searching tree nodes. Another thing to notice is that: when searchign through all the nodes, treat every node as a parent, and get the max by adding left children and right children if they are positive. 

## Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:

        self.max_num = root.val

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0

            left = max(0, dfs(node.left))
            right = max(0, dfs(node.right))
            
            path_sum = left + right + node.val
            self.max_num = max(self.max_num, path_sum)
            
            return node.val + left if left > right else node.val + right
        dfs(root)
        return self.max_num
```
