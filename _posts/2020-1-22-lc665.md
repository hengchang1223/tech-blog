categories: [Greedy Algorithm]

## Description:
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for every `i` (0-based) such that `(0 <= i <= n - 2)`.

## Example:
Input: `nums = [4,2,3]`

Output: `True`

Input: `nums = [4,2,1]`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Obviously this problem can be done by only go through the whole array once, only problem is how can we make sure that modifying one element will not affect other elements. Two edge cases are simple, the beginning and the end of array, if they are not smaller than next element or not bigger than previous element, you can just skip them and add one to violation count `chance -= 1`. How about the elements in middle? 

Imagine this case, `x1 <= x2 > x3 <= x4`. If you make `x2` smaller so that `x2 <= x3`, then you have to make sure new `x2` will still bigger than `x1`. Also, if you want to make `x3` bigger, you have to make sure it won't affect the truth that `x2 <= x3`.

## Solution:
```python
def checkPossibility(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    chance = 1
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        if i == 0 or i == len(nums) - 2:
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                chance -= 1
        else:
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                if nums[i-1] <= nums[i+1]:
                    nums[i] = nums[i+1]
                    chance -= 1
                elif nums[i] <= nums[i+2]:
                    nums[i+1] = nums[i]
                    chance -= 1
                else:
                    return False
        if chance < 0:
            return False
    return True
```
