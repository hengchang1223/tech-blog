title:  "LeetCode 200. Number of Islands (April Challenge Day #17)" 
lcid: 200
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Example:
Input:
```
11110
11010
11000
00000
```

Output: `1`

Input:
```
11000
11000
00100
00011
```

Output: `3`

## Solution Explanation:
Common DFS problem, only difference is that along the way of DFS, you need to reassign the value from `'1'` to `'0'` so that you won't repeat counting that value.

## Solution:

```python
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0])
    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= m or c >= n or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        grid[r][c] = '0'
        dfs(r+1, c)
        dfs(r-1, c)
        dfs(r, c+1)
        dfs(r, c-1)
    
    island = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == '1':
                dfs(i, j)
                island += 1
    return island
```
