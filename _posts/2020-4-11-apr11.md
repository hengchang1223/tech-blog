title:  "LeetCode 543. Diameter of Binary Tree (April Challenge Day #11)" 
lcid: 543
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Example:
Input: 
```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5  
```

Output: `3`, which is the length of the path `[4,2,1,3]`

## Solution Explanation:
Use Recursion to do tree traversal. However, one thing worth to notice is: you need to set a global variable so that you can easily update the value along the recursion.

## Solution:

```python
def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
    self.ans = 1
    def depth(node):
        if not node: return 0
        L = depth(node.left)
        R = depth(node.right)
        self.ans = max(self.ans, L+R+1)
        return max(L, R) + 1

    depth(root)
    return self.ans - 1
```
