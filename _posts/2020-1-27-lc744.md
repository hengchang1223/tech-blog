lcid: 744
categories: [Binary Search]
---
## Description:
Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is target = 'z' and letters = ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.

## Example:
Input: `letters = ['c', 'f', 'j']` `target = 'a'`

Output: `'c'`

Input: `letters = ['c', 'f', 'j']` `target = 'c'`

Output: `'f'`

## Solution Explanation:
Typical binary search problem, only thing to remember is that there might be repeated chars, so you cannot use equal in if statement. So instead of using:

```python
if char == target:
    return xxx
elif char < target:
    left = mid + 1
else:
    right = mid - 1
```

You have to use:

```python
if char <= target:
    left = mid + 1
else:
    right = mid - 1
```

## Solution:
```python
def nextGreatestLetter(letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
    left = 0
    right = len(letters) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        char = letters[mid]
        if char <= target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return letters[right+1] if right < len(letters) - 1 else letters[0]
```
