title:  "LeetCode 237. Delete Node in a Linked List (June Challenge Day #2)" 
categories: [June Challenge]
---
## Description:
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

## Example:
Input: `head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5`

Output: `[4,1,9]`

Input: `head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1`

Output: `[4,5,9]`

## Solution Explanation:
Sure you can loop through the Linked List from head to tail and find the previous node of the given node, and remove the given node from its previous node. However, the easiest way is to copy the value of given node's next node, and delete the next node of the given node.

## Solution:

```python
def deleteNode(self, node):
    node.val = node.next.val
    node.next = node.next.next
```
