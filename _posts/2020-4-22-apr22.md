title:  "LeetCode 560. Subarray Sum Equals K (April Challenge Day #22)" 
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

## Example:
Input: `nums = [1,1,1], k = 2`

Output: `2`

## Solution Explanation:
The optimal solution for this problem is very very **tricky**. Even if you already know you are going to use HashMap, you will find it will still be very hard to come up with. 

So the idea is: you need to loop through the entire array and keep track of the current sum in a HashMap, which is the sum of all the elements from the beginning to the current element. Then in each loop, you also need to check if `curr_sum - k` is in the HashMap because it means that the sum of elements from the loop which `curr_sum - k` was put into the HashMap to the current loop will be `k`.

For example, in the case of `nums = [3,4,7,-3,-4,14], k = 7`, `curr_sum` will be `3,7,14,11,7,21`, and the HashMap will be `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 2, 14: 1, 11: 1, 21: 1}` with the initialization `{0:1}` in case of the `curr_sum` will equal to `k` during the loop. As you can see, when `curr_sum == 7`, HashMap will contain `0` with `1` value. Also when `curr_sum == 14`, the HashMap will contain `14-7` with `1` value. The remain are obvious.

## Solution:

```python
def subarraySum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    d = {0:1}
    curr = 0
    res = 0
    for num in nums:
        curr += num
        if curr-k in d:
            res += d[curr-k]
        d[curr] = d.get(curr, 0) + 1
    print(d)
    return res
```
