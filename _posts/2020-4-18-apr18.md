title:  "LeetCode 64. Minimum Path Sum (April Challenge Day #18)" 
lcid: 64
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which _minimizes_ the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Example:
Input:
```
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
```

Output: `7`

## Solution Explanation:
Typical **Dynamic Programming** problem, even the problem itself came as a **DP** form. The time complexity will just be like other **DP** problems (Basically like Brute Force). But you can use only one row extra space to do the memoization to avoid using a whole matrix extra space.

## Solution:

```python
def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not grid:
        return 0

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    prev = [sum(grid[0][:i+1]) for i in range(n)]
    curr = [0] * n

    for i in range(1, m):
        curr[0] = prev[0] + grid[i][0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            curr[j] = min(curr[j-1], prev[j]) + grid[i][j]
        prev = curr
        curr = [0] * n

    return prev[-1]
```
