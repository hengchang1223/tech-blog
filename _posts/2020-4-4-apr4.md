title:  "LeetCode 283. Move Zeroes (April Challenge Day #4)"
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

## Example:
Input: `[0,1,0,3,12]`

Output: `[1,3,12,0,0]`

## Solution Explanation:
Very similar to [Dutch Flag]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2020-01-13-sorting %}) problem, maintain two pointers and switch positions while one pointer points to the boundary of two kinds of elements, the other loops through the whole array to find elements that meet some conditions of switching.

## Solution:
```python
def moveZeroes(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    p1 = p2 = 0
    while p2 < len(nums):
        if nums[p2] != 0:
            nums[p1], nums[p2] = nums[p2], nums[p1]
            p1 += 1
        p2 += 1
```
