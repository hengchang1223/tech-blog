title:  "LeetCode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array"
categories: [Binary Search]
---
## Description:
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

## Example:
Input: `[3,4,5,1,2]`

Output: `1`

Input: `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
A little bit tricky, the point is to find the position that connect the bigger half and the smaller half. In the case of `[4,5,6,1,2]`, the first `mid` position is `6`, which is bigger than the `right` position `2`. So the connect point must be on the right of this `mid` position, we make the `left = mid + 1`. While in the case of `[4,5,1,2,3]`, the first `mid` position is `1`, which is smaller than the `right` position `3`. So the connect point must be on the left of this `mid` position, we make the `right = mid`.

## Solution:
```python
def findMin(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[right]:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return nums[left]
```
