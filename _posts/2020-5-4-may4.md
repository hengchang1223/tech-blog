title:  "LeetCode 476. Number Complement (May Challenge Day #4)" 
lcid: 476
categories: [May Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a **positive** integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

## Example:
Input: `num = 5`

Output: `2`

Input: `num = 1`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
Since Python is kind of unique, the integer is actually not limited by bits. So you have to keep track of how many bits are there for one integer by yourself.

In this problem, what you need to do is to flip the bit (`0->1` and `1->0`) when going through all the valid bits from the original bits.

## Solution:

```python
def findComplement(num: int) -> int:
    res = 0
    i = 0
    while num:
        res += ((num & 1) ^ 1) << i
        i += 1
        num >>= 1
    return res
```
