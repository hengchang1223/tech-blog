title:  "LeetCode 347. Top K Frequent Elements"
lcid: 347
categories: [Sorting]
---
## Description:
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the **k** most frequent elements.

## Example:
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]` `k = 2`

Output: `[1,2]`

Input: `nums = [1]` `k = 1`

Output: `[1]`

## Solution Explanation:
The problem requires better performance than `O(nlog n)`, so I am thinking to sacrifice more space for better time complexity. Here comes the Bucket Sort. Consider create a HashMap, record the frequence of all integers. `[1,1,1,2,2,3]` will be `{1:3, 2:2, 3:1}`. Then flip the HashMap to turn its values into keys and keys into values. Since frequency may be overlapped, we need to store the values in list like this `{3:[1], 2:[2], 1:[3]}`. Now we just need to loop through the HashMap by searching frequencies from the biggest frequency which is `len(nums)` to 0. And once you get **k** elements, return.

## Solution:
```python
def topKFrequent(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    d = {}
    for num in nums:
        d[num] = d.get(num, 0) + 1

    d_reverse = {}
    for key, value in d.items():
        d_reverse[value] = d_reverse.get(value, []) + [key]

    i = len(nums)
    res = []
    while len(res) < k:
        while i not in d_reverse:
            i -= 1
        res += d_reverse[i]
        i -= 1
    return res
```
