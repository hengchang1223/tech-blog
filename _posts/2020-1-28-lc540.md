title:  "LeetCode 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array"
lcid: 540
categories: [Binary Search]

## Description:
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Follow up: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

## Example:
Input: `nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]`

Output: `2`

Input: `nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]`

Output: `10`

## Solution Explanation:
`O(N)` will be a very easy way to implement, which is **XOR**. And here requires `O(log n)`, which means you need to use the index of the array to solve this problem. Since it is sorted, you can easily identify the element is at the left side or right side of your current element (by checking the other element is at even index or odd index). 

Normally, one pair of element in array will be like this: `[1,1]`. The first `1` is at **0** position which is even, and the second `1` is at **1** position which is odd. So if you calculate the `mid` of `left` and `right`, and find out `mid` is even, then the other element which equals to the element in `mid` index should be at position `mid+1`. If it is at `mid-1`, then there must be a single element in front of them. 

## Solution:
```python
def singleNonDuplicate(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]
    right = n - 1
    left = 0
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if mid % 2 == 1:
            mid -= 1
        num = nums[mid]
        if nums[mid+1] == num:
            left = mid + 2
        else:
            right = mid
    return nums[left]
```
