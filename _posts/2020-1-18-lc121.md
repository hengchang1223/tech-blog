title:  "LeetCode 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"
categories: [Greedy Algorithm]
---
## Description:
Say you have an array for which the $i^{th}$ element is the price of a given stock on day $i$.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

## Example:
Input: `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`

Output: `5`

Input: `[7,6,4,3,1]`

Output:`0`

## Solution Explanation:
Straight forward enough. Just one note, this kind of optimization problem often need you to sort or loop through the entire array. Just remember what to keep along the loop and what to update!!

## Solution:
```python
def maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    res = 0
    curr = prices[0] if prices else None
    for num in prices:
        if num < curr:
            curr = num
        else:
            res = max(res, num - curr)
    return res
```
