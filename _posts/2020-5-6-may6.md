title:  "LeetCode 169. Majority Element (May Challenge Day #6)"
lcid: 169
categories: [May Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears **more than** `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

## Example:
Input: `[3,2,3]`

Output: `3`

Input: `[2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`

Output: `2`

## Solution Explanation:
Notice that there will be an element that appears more times than all other elements combined, which means if you go through the entire array, and use that element to cancel out every other element, the remains will still be that specific element.

In this case, **Stack** data structure can be very handy, you can just append same element in stack, and when you find different elements, you cancel out one element in stack. Once the stack is empty again, you start to put whatever element in. Repeat these steps until you explore all elements, and the result will be that majority element.

## Solution:

```python
def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    storage = []
    for num in nums:
        if not storage:
            storage.append(num)
        elif num == storage[-1]:
            storage.append(num)
        else:
            storage.pop(0)

    return storage[0]
```
