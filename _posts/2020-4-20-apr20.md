title:  "LeetCode 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal (April Challenge Day #20)" 
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given `preorder` traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of `node.left` has a value `< node.val`, and any descendant of node.right has a value `> node.val`.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the `node` first, then traverses `node.left`, then traverses `node.right`.)

It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements.

## Example:
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]

Output: 
```
        8
      /   \
    5       10
  /   \       \
1       7       12
```

## Solution Explanation:
When the problem is about Tree Traversal, it is very likely that Recursion will fit this problem very well like this problem : [LeetCode 543. Diameter of Binary Tree]({% post_url 2020-4-11-apr11 %}).

In this problem, there are more than just recursion. Since you are rebuilding **Binary Search Tree**, you must keep track of correct range for node. For instance, after you build `[8,5,1]`, you can not assign the right child of `1` to be `7` just because `7 > 1`. You have to record the suitable range for node `1` which is `(-inf,5)`, and apparently `7` is out of range for node `1`. Same idea, for value `10`, you can not assign the right child of node `7` to be `10` because `10` is even bigger than the root of this tree. 

## Solution:

```python
def bstFromPreorder(preorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
    if not preorder:
        return None
    head = TreeNode(preorder.pop(0))
    def build(node, parent):
        if preorder:
            if preorder[0] < node.val:
                node.left = TreeNode(preorder[0])
                build(node.left, node.val)
            if preorder and preorder[0] > node.val and preorder[0] < parent:
                node.right = TreeNode(preorder[0])
                build(node.right, parent)
    build(head, float('inf'))
    return head
```
