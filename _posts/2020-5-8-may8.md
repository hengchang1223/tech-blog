title:  "LeetCode 1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line (May Challenge Day #8)"
lcid: 1232
categories: [May Challenge]
---
## Description:
You are given an array `coordinates`, `coordinates[i] = [x, y]`, where `[x, y]` represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

## Example:
Input: `coordinates = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]]`

Output: `True`

Input: `coordinates = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[7,7]]`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Use Math knowledge to solve this problem, two points can decide one line, so if there are less than two points in the array, it should return `False`. If there are exactly two points, then it should return `True` since they can decide exact one line. Other than those cases, you can use the first point and the second point to get a line, then loop through other points to see if they are on that line.

## Solution:

```python
def checkStraightLine(coordinates: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(coordinates)
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    elif n == 2:
        return True
    else:
        p0, p1 = coordinates[0], coordinates[1]
        if p0[0] == p1[0]:
            return all([p[0] == p0[0] for p in coordinates])
        else:
            k = (p1[1] - p0[1]) / (p1[0] - p0[0])
            b = p0[1] - k * p0[0]
            for p in coordinates[2:]:
                if p[1] != k * p[0] + b:
                    return False
            return True
```
