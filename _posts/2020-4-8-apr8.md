title:  "LeetCode 876. Middle of the Linked List (April Challenge Day #7)" 
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Example:
Input: `[1,2,3,4,5]`

Output: Node `3` from this list

Input: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

Output: Node `4` from this list

## Solution Explanation:
Two pointers in Linked List, using one fast pointer and one slow pointer to do this trick.

## Solution:

```python
def middleNode(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
    return slow
```
