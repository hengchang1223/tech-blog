title:  "LeetCode Counting Elements (April Challenge Day #7)"
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an integer array `arr`, count how many elements `x` there are, such that `x + 1` is also in `arr`.

If there're duplicates in `arr`, count them seperately.

## Example:
Input: `arr = [1,2,3]`

Output: `2`

Input: `[1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
Typical usage of HashSet and HashMap. Remember to check `num-1` so that you will not miss any numbers because of order.

## Solution:
```python
def countElements(arr):
    d = {}
    result = set()
    for num in arr:
        d[num] = d.get(num, 0) + 1
        if num-1 in d:
            result.add(num-1)
        if num+1 in d:
            result.add(num)
    return sum([d[s] for s in result])
```
