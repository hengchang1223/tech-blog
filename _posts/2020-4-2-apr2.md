## Description:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

## Example:
Input: `19`

Output: `True`

## Solution Explanation:
This problem is very like a brain teaser, you need to figure out that after a couple of times looping one integer will become some integers which have already occured before if this integer is not happy number. After you figure this out, only thing you need to do is to keep looping until 1 comes out or some integers that occured before come out.

## Solution:
```python
def isHappy(n: int) -> bool:
    def calc(num):
        res = 0
        while num:
            res += pow(num%10, 2)
            num //= 10
        return res
    s = set()
    while n != 1 and n not in s:
        s.add(n)
        n = calc(n)
    return n == 1
```
