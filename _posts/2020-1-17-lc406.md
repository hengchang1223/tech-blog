title:  "LeetCode 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height"
lcid: 406
categories: [Greedy Algorithm]
---
## Description:
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

## Example:
Input: `[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]`

Output: `[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]`

### Solution Explanation:
Most important idea for this problem is to find out that when you insert shorter people into taller people array, the relative position of taller people won't change. So that is a hint indicate that maybe we should insert people by the descending order of height.

#### Solution:
```python
def reconstructQueue(people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    people.sort(key = lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
    print(people)
    res = []
    for person in people:
        res.insert(person[1], person)
    return res
```
