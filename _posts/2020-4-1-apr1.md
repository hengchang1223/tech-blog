categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example:
Input: `[2,2,1]`

Output: `1`

Input: `[4,1,2,1,2]`

Output: `4`

## Solution Explanation:
Classic `XOR` example, using the idea that `x ^ x == 0`, so loop through all integers in the array and the result will be that single integer.

## Solution:
```python
def singleNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    res = 0
    for num in nums:
        res ^= num

    return res
```
