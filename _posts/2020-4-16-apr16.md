title:  "LeetCode 678. Valid Parenthesis String (April Challenge Day #16)"
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

1. Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
2. Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
3. Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
4. '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string.
5. An empty string is also valid.

## Example:
Input: `'()'`

Output: `True`

Input: `'(*)'`

Output: `True`

Input: `'(*))'`

Output: `True`

## Solution Explanation:
Since there are `'*'` can be treated as both `'('` and `')'`, it is going to be tricky when deciding if the parennthesis string is valid. Effective way to deal with the wiggle room that `'*'` brings is to keep track of the range instead of the exact number of how many `'('` are there. Here set up two variables: `min_left` and `max_left`. `min_left` decides whether all `'('` can be paired with `'*'` or `')'` eventually, and `max_left` decides whether there will be cases such that `')'` have no `'('` to pair with. 

## Solution:

```python
def checkValidString(s: str) -> bool:
    min_left, max_left = 0, 0
    for ch in s:
        min_left += 1 if ch == '(' else -1
        max_left -= 1 if ch == ')' else -1
        if max_left < 0:
            return False
        min_left = max(0, min_left)
    return min_left == 0
```
