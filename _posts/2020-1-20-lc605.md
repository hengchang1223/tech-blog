## Description:
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number **n**, return if **n** new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

## Example:
Input: `[1,0,0,0,1]` `n = 1`

Output: `True`

Input: `[1,0,0,0,1]` `n = 2`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Typical idea for Greedy Algorithm, local optimal will make global optimal. Just take a loop through the entire array, and be careful when writing the condition.

## Solution:
```python
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
    if n == 0:
        return True

    if not flowerbed:
        return False

    if len(flowerbed) == 1:
        return n == 1 and flowerbed[0] == 0

    i = 0
    while i < len(flowerbed):
        if n <= 0:
            return True

        if i == 0:
            if flowerbed[i] == flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
                n -= 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1
        elif i == len(flowerbed) - 1:
            if flowerbed[i] == flowerbed[i-1] == 0:
                n -= 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1
        else:
            if flowerbed[i] == flowerbed[i-1] == flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
                n -= 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1
        i += 1
    return n <= 0
```
