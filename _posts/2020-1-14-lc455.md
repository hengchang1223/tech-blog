title:  "LeetCode 455. Assign Cookies"
lcid: 455
categories: [Greedy Algorithm]
---
## Description:
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Note:**
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

## Example:
Input: `[1,2,3]` `[1,1]`

Output: `1`

Input: `[1,2]` `[1,2,3]`

Output: `2`

## Solution Explanation:
Greedy Algorithm is not as technical like other algorithms, basically it's about guess and prove. You have to guess a solution and to prove that is the way to go. This problem is straightforward because if a small size cookie can not satisfy a not-very-greed child, then it is not going to satisfy more greedy child. So after sorting child array and cookie array, only thing you need to do is to loop through child array and also keep track of a pointer that points to the cookie array so that you will not use the same cookie twice.

## Solution:
```python
def findContentChildren(g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
    g.sort()
    s.sort()
    p1 = p2 = 0
    res = 0
    while p1 < len(g) and p2 < len(s):
        if g[p1] <= s[p2]:
            res += 1
            p1 += 1
        p2 += 1
    return res
```
