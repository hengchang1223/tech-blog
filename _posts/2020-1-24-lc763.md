## Description:
A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

## Example:
Input: `S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"`

Output: `[9, 7, 8]`

## Solution Explanation:
Since the problem requires as many parts as possible, it will be very helpful to have a HashMap that tells you the last index of every char in the string. 

Once we have that HashMap, we can start looping through the whole string, the idea is always keep track of the biggest index of all characters so far once started. And if the current index equal to the biggest index so far, get the length of that group and append to the result array, then assign a new start with a new biggest index.

## Solution:
```python
def partitionLabels(S: str) -> List[int]:
    d = {}
    for i in range(len(S)):
        d[S[i]] = i
    print(d)

    res = []
    start = -1
    curr = d[S[0]]
    for j in range(len(S)):
        temp = S[j]
        if d[temp] <= curr:
            if j == curr:
                res.append(j - start)
                start = j
                if j < len(S) - 1:
                    curr = d[S[j+1]]
        else:
            curr = d[temp]
    return res
```
