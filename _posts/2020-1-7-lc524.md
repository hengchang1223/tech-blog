title:  "LeetCode 524. Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting"
lcid: 524
categories: [Two Pointers]
---
## Description:
Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

## Example:
Input: `s = "abpcplea"` `d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]`

Output: `"apple"`

Input: `s = "abpcplea"` `d = ["a","b","c"]`

Output: `"a"`

## Solution Explanation:
Assign two pointers, one pointer `p1` points at `s`, the other pointer `p2` points at element in `d`. Assign a list `candidate` to store the current longest word, by comparing each potential longest word in `d` to decide if the word is going to replace the word in `candidate` or insert into `candidate`.  

## Solution:
```python
def findLongestWord(s: str, d: List[str]) -> str:
    def canBeFormed(word, s):
        p = 0
        for ch in word:
            while p < len(s) and s[p] != ch:
                p += 1
            if p >= len(s) or s[p] != ch:
                return False
            p += 1
        return True

    candidate = ''
    for word in d:
        if candidate == '':
            if canBeFormed(word, s):
                candidate = word
        else:
            if len(word) > len(candidate):
                if canBeFormed(word, s):
                    candidate = word
            elif len(word) == len(candidate):
                if canBeFormed(word, s):
                    candidate = word if word < candidate else candidate
    return candidate
```
