title:  "LeetCode 49. Group Anagrams (April Challenge Day #6)"
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

## Example:
Input: `["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`

Output: `[["ate","eat","tea"],["nat","tan"],["bat"]]`

## Solution Explanation:
Use array to store the occurence of each character for each word, so that we will not treat `'aaaaa'` and `'a'` as the same word. And use HashMap to store words. 

## Solution:
```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    def getList(s):
        res = [0] * 26
        base = ord('a')
        for c in s:
            res[ord(c)-base] += 1
        return tuple(res)

    d = {}
    for s in strs:
        temp = getList(s)
        if temp in d:
            d[temp].append(s)
        else:
            d[temp] = [s]
    return d.values()
```
