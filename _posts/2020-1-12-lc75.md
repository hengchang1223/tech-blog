title:  "LeetCode 75. Sort Colors"
categories: [Sorting]
---
## Description:
Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

## Example:
Input: `[2,0,2,1,1,0]`

Output: `[0,0,1,1,2,2]`

## Solution Explanation:
Two passes solution is straightforward, How about one pass solution? Actually it is pretty simple, all you need to do is to keep 3 pointers, respectively point to 

1. one-element right of rightmost '0'
2. the current element which is under examination
3. one-element left of leftmost '2'

Then just loop once through all the elements in the array, make the swap when needed. This is also known as the **Dutch Flag Problem**.

## Solution:
```python
def sortColors(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
    """
    p1, p2, p3 = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
    while p2 <= p3:
        if nums[p2] == 0:
            nums[p1], nums[p2] = nums[p2], nums[p1]
            p1 += 1
            p2 += 1
        elif nums[p2] == 2:
            nums[p3], nums[p2] = nums[p2], nums[p3]
            p3 -= 1
        else:
            p2 += 1
```
