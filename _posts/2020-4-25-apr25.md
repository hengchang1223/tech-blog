## Description:
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

## Example:
Input: `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`

Output: `True`

Input: `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]`

Output: `False`

## Solution Explanation:
Typical **Dynamic Programming** problem, loop through all steps, in each step, update the farest you can reach by `curr_max = max(curr_max, i + nums[i])`. Then, return `True` if the `curr_max` is bigger than the length of array.

## Solution:

```python
def canJump(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not nums:
        return False
    n = len(nums)
    curr_max = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i <= curr_max and curr_max < n - 1:
            curr_max = max(curr_max, i + nums[i])
        else:
            break
    return curr_max >= n - 1
```
