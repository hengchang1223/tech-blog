## Description:
You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

## Example:
Input: `J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"`

Output: `3`

Input: `J = "z", S = "ZZ"`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
Easy application of HashSet.

## Solution:

```python
def numJewelsInStones(J: str, S: str) -> int:
    if not J or not S:
        return 0
    jewel = set(J)
    res = 0
    for ch in S:
        if ch in jewel:
            res += 1
    return res
```
