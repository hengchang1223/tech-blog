title:  "LeetCode 383. Ransom Note (May Challenge Day #3)" 
categories: [May Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

## Example:
Input: `ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"`

Output: `False`

Input: `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"`

Output: `False`

Input: `ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"`

Output: `True`

## Solution Explanation:
First collect chars and #chars in HashMap, and loop through `ransomNote` to check if there are enough chars for building the note.

## Solution:

```python
def canConstruct(ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
    d = {}
    for ch in magazine:
        if ch in d:
            d[ch] += 1
        else:
            d[ch] = 1

    for ch in ransomNote:
        if ch in d and d[ch] >= 1:
            d[ch] -= 1
            continue
        else:
            return False
    return True
```
