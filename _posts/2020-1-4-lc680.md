title:  "LeetCode 680. Valid Palindrome II"
categories: [Two Pointers]
---
## Description:
Given a non-empty string `s`, you may delete **at most** one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

## Example:
Input: `"aba"`

Output: `True`

Input: `"abca"`

Output: `True`

## Solution Explanation:
Use two pointers to keep track of both ends of the string. When first different pair occurs, check two different cases to see if **Palindrome** can be made by deleting one character.

## Solution:
```python
def validPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    p1, p2 = 0, len(s) - 1
    while p1 < p2:
        if s[p1] != s[p2]:
            temp1 = s[p1+1:p2+1]
            temp2 = s[p1:p2]
            return temp1 == temp1[::-1] or temp2 == temp2[::-1]
        p1 += 1
        p2 -= 1
    return True
```
