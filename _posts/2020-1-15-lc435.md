title:  "LeetCode 435. Non-overlapping Intervals"
lcid: 435
categories: [Greedy Algorithm]
---
## Description:
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Example:
Input: `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`

Output: `1`

Input: `[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]`

Output: `2`

Input: `[[1,2],[2,3]]`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
Classic interval overlapping problem, the idea is to first sort them by their finish time, and decide which interval will be removed by comparing it.

## Solution:
```python
def eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not intervals:
        return 0
    intervals.sort(key = lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
    res = [intervals[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] >= res[-1][1]:
            res.append(intervals[i])
    return len(intervals) - len(res)
```
