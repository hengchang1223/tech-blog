## Description:
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Example:
Input: `4`

Output: `2`

Input: `8`

Output: `2`

## Solution Explanation:
Once thing to notice: Make the right boundary the element itself to improve time complexity.

## Solution:
```python
def mySqrt(x: int) -> int:
    high = x
    low = 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        product = mid * mid
        if product == x:
            return mid
        elif product < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return high
```
