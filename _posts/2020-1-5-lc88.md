title:  "LeetCode 88. Merge Sorted Array"
categories: [Two Pointers]
---

## Description:
Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

## Example:
Input: `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]  nums2 = [2,5,6]`

Output: `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`

## Solution Explanation:
Use three pointers, `p1` points to `3` which is `nums1[2]`, `p2` points to `6` which is `nums2[2]`. By comparing which is bigger to decide which element will go to the end of the `nums1`. Use another pointer `p3` to keep track of which position will be filled into in `nums1`.

## Solution:
```python
def merge(nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    p1, p2, p3 = m - 1, n - 1, m + n - 1
    while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
        if nums1[p1] >= nums2[p2]:
            nums1[p3] = nums1[p1]
            p1 -= 1
        else:
            nums1[p3] = nums2[p2]
            p2 -= 1
        p3 -= 1

    if p1 < 0:
        while p2 >= 0:
            nums1[p3] = nums2[p2]
            p3 -= 1
            p2 -= 1
    return nums1
```
