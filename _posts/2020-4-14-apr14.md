title:  "LeetCode Perform String Shifts (April Challenge Day #14)" 
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix `shift`, where `shift[i] = [direction, amount]`:

- `direction` can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift). 
- `amount` is the amount by which string `s is to be shifted.
- A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.
- Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.

## Example:
Input: `s = 'abc', shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]`

Output: `'cab'`

Input: `s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]`

Output: `'efgabcd'`

## Solution Explanation:
Very straightforward problem, only thing worth to notice is to remember to modual the result so that the index will be correct.

## Solution:

```python
def stringShift(s, shift):
    finalShift = 0
    for pair in shift:
        if pair[0] == 0:
            finalShift += pair[1]
        else:
            finalShift -= pair[1]
    finalShift %= len(s)
    return s[finalShift:] + s[:finalShift]
```
