title:  "LeetCode 451. Sort Characters By Frequency"
categories: [Sorting]
---
## Description:
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

## Example:
Input: `"tree"`

Output: `"eert"` or `"eetr"`

Input: `"cccaaa"`

Output: `"cccaaa"` or `"aaaccc"`

Input: `"Aabb"`

Output: `"bbAa"`

## Solution Explanation:
Like the problem above, using `O(N)` space to store frequencies of all characters, and reverse that HashMap to get a frequency table. Variant of Bucket Sort.

## Solution:
```python3
def frequencySort(s: str) -> str:
    d = {}
    for ch in s:
        d[ch] = d.get(ch, 0) + 1

    d_reverse = {}
    for k, v in d.items():
        d_reverse[v] = d_reverse.get(v, []) + [k]

    res = ''
    for i in range(len(s), -1, -1):
        if i in d_reverse:
            for c in d_reverse[i]:
                res += i * c
    return res
```
