title:  "LeetCode 525. Contiguous Array (April Challenge Day #13)" 
lcid: 525
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

## Example:
Input: `[0,1]`

Output: `2`

Input: `[0,1,0]`

Output: `2`

## Solution Explanation:
After trying some cases, you may find out that if you keep track of a `sum` value that you add 1 to it when you come across `0` element, and subtract 1 from it when you come across `1` element. Then in each loop you keep track of the `sum` and the current index of array as the corresponding index of `sum` variable. Then if a specific `sum` value occurs twice, you can update the global max value if it is actually bigger. 

## Solution:

```python
def findMaxLength(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    res = 0
    curr_sum = 0
    d = {0:-1}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        curr_sum += 1 if nums[i] else -1
        if curr_sum in d:
            res = max(res, i - d[curr_sum])
        else:
            d[curr_sum] = i
    print(d)
    return res

```
