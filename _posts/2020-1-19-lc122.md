title:  "LeetCode 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II"
categories: [Greedy Algorithm]
---
## Description:
Say you have an array `prices` for which the `ith` element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Example:
Input: `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`

Output: `7`

Input: `[1,2,3,4,5]`

Output: `4`

Input: `[7,6,4,3,1]`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
Like a follow up of previous question, also very straight forward. 

## Solution:
```python
def maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    res = 0
    curr = prices[0] if prices else None
    for num in prices:
        if num > curr:
            res += num - curr
        curr = num
    return res
```
