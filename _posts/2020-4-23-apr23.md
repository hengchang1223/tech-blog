categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

## Example:
Input: `[5,7]`

Output: `4`

Input: `[0,1]`

Output: `0`

## Solution Explanation:
Tricky problem about Bit Manipulation. Since the problem requires all numbers within that range should be combined with `&` operation, let's try one. Consider the range from 37 to 46, 37 is `00100101` and 46 is `00101110`. After applying `&` to all the numbers, the result is `00100000`.

And the solution is to think of this problem like a prefix-seeking problem. Idea is: use `x & (x-1)` to shrink the upper bound until the upper bound is smaller or equal to the lower bound, then return the upper bound `&` lower bound. 

## Solution:

```python
def rangeBitwiseAnd(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    while m < n:
        n = n & (n - 1)
    return m & n
```
