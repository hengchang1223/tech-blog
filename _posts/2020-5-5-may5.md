title:  "LeetCode 387. First Unique Character in a String (May Challenge Day #5)"
lcid: 387
categories: [May Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

## Example:
Input: `s = "leetcode"`

Output: `0`

Input: `s = "loveleetcode"`

Output: `2`

## Solution Explanation:
Since you need to keep track of both element and its frequency, **HashMap** should be the first data structure you think of. After collect all the information into HashMap, you can start another loop and check the HashMap so that you can find the first element that only occured once.

## Solution:

```python
def firstUniqChar(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return -1

    chars = {}
    for ch in s:
        if ch not in chars:
            chars[ch] = True
        else:
            chars[ch] = False

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if chars[s[i]]:
            return i
    return -1
```
