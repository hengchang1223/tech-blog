## Description:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Example:
Input: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`

Output: `6`

## Solution Explanation:
This is a very basic and easy version problem of many variants. In this basic case, one loop through the array will solve this problem. Use a variable to record the current sum, and for each element in the array, check if the current sum bigger than 0, add new element to the current sum if it is bigger than 0, otherwise assign the new element to current sum. In each loop, compare the current sum to global maximum so that it will not miss any possible local maximum.

## Solution:
```python
def maxSubArray(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    res = float('-inf')
    curr = 0
    for num in nums:
        if curr >= 0:
            curr += num
        else:
            curr = num
        res = max(res, curr)
    return res if nums else None
```
