title:  "LeetCode 238. Product of Array Except Self (April Challenge Day #15)" 
lcid: 238
categories: [April Challenge]
---
## Description:
Given an array `nums` of n integers where n > 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

## Example:
Input: `[1,2,3,4]`

Output: `[24,12,8,6]`

## Solution Explanation:
The problem requires the solution can not use division and must in `O(n)` time complexity. And follow up even requires `O(1)` space complexity. The solution for this is to run two loops, one from left to right multiply numbers to `output` array. So start with `output = [1,1,1,1]`, then after the first loop, `output` becomes `[1,1,2,6]`. The other loop goes from right to left, make `output` become like this: `[24,12,8,6]`.

## Solution:

```python
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [0]*n
    result[0] = 1

    for i in range(1, n):
        result[i] = result[i-1] * nums[i-1]

    r = 1
    for j in range(n):
        result[n-1-j] *= r
        r *= nums[n-1-j]

    return result
```
